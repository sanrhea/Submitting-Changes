## 1. What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network.

- Created by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**
- Introduced in a 2008 white paper: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*

## 2. How Bitcoin Works

Bitcoin operates on a decentralized ledger called the **blockchain**, maintained by a distributed network of nodes.

Key components:
- Public and private keys
- Decentralized consensus
- Peer-to-peer transactions

---

## 3. Blockchain Technology

The **blockchain** is a growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography.

- Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block
- Immutable and transparent
- Secured via Proof-of-Work (PoW)

## 4. Bitcoin Mining

Mining is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced and transactions are verified.

- Involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles
- Rewards include new bitcoins and transaction fees
- Halves approximately every 4 years (halving event)

## 5. Bitcoin Wallets

A **Bitcoin wallet** stores the private keys needed to access and spend bitcoins.

Types of wallets:
- Hot Wallets (software-based, connected to internet)
- Cold Wallets (hardware wallets or paper wallets)

## 6. Bitcoin Transactions

Bitcoin transactions are signed using private keys and broadcasted to the network.

Steps:
1. Input ‚Äì Reference to the source of the coins
2. Amount ‚Äì How much BTC is being sent
3. Output ‚Äì Recipient's address

All transactions are irreversible once confirmed.

## 7. Security and Privacy

- **Pseudonymous**: Wallets are not tied to identities by default
- **Security threats**: Phishing, malware, exchange hacks
- **Best practices**: Use hardware wallets, enable 2FA, verify addresses

## 8. Use Cases

- Digital store of value ("Digital Gold")
- Cross-border payments
- Financial inclusion in unbanked regions
- Hedge against inflation (in some views)

## 9. Limitations and Criticisms

- High energy consumption (due to Proof-of-Work)
- Scalability limitations (limited transactions per second)
- Volatility
- Regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions
